# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on improving the availability detail functionality in AgentCal. Currently, users can navigate from the availability list to individual availability pages, but the detail page uses mock data instead of real API data. Additionally, the visual design of the detail page needs enhancement to provide a better user experience. This improvement will ensure that users can properly view and edit their availability schedules with real data and an improved interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view the details of a specific availability schedule so that I can see the actual data for that schedule.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on "View" or "Edit" from the availability list THEN the system SHALL navigate to the availability detail page with the correct schedule ID
2. WHEN the availability detail page loads THEN the system SHALL fetch the actual schedule data from the API using the schedule ID
3. WHEN the API call is successful THEN the system SHALL display the real schedule data including name, timezone, weekly slots, and metadata
4. WHEN the API call fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message to the user
5. WHEN the schedule data is loading THEN the system SHALL show a loading state to indicate data is being fetched

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to edit my availability schedule details so that I can update my schedule information and weekly time slots.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the "Edit" button on the availability detail page THEN the system SHALL enable edit mode for the schedule
2. WHEN in edit mode THEN the system SHALL allow the user to modify the schedule name, weekly time slots, and day availability
3. WHEN a user saves changes THEN the system SHALL send a PUT request to update the schedule via the API
4. WHEN the update is successful THEN the system SHALL show a success message and refresh the schedule data
5. WHEN the update fails THEN the system SHALL show an error message and maintain the edit state
6. WHEN a user cancels editing THEN the system SHALL revert any unsaved changes and exit edit mode

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the availability detail page to have an improved visual design so that I can easily understand and interact with my schedule information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the availability detail page THEN the system SHALL display a clean, organized layout with clear visual hierarchy
2. WHEN viewing weekly schedule information THEN the system SHALL present time slots in an easy-to-read format with clear day labels
3. WHEN viewing schedule metadata THEN the system SHALL organize information in well-structured cards or sections
4. WHEN interacting with time controls THEN the system SHALL provide intuitive time selection interfaces
5. WHEN viewing enabled/disabled days THEN the system SHALL use clear visual indicators to show availability status
6. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent styling with the rest of the application

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a proper API endpoint to fetch individual availability schedules so that the frontend can retrieve specific schedule data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API receives a GET request to `/availability/:id` THEN the system SHALL return the specific availability schedule with the provided ID
2. WHEN the schedule exists THEN the system SHALL return the schedule data including weekly slots and metadata
3. WHEN the schedule does not exist THEN the system SHALL return a 404 Not Found error
4. WHEN the user is not authorized to view the schedule THEN the system SHALL return a 403 Forbidden error
5. WHEN there is a server error THEN the system SHALL return a 500 Internal Server Error with appropriate error message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a proper API endpoint to update individual availability schedules so that users can modify their schedule data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API receives a PUT request to `/availability/:id` THEN the system SHALL update the specific availability schedule with the provided data
2. WHEN the update is successful THEN the system SHALL return the updated schedule data
3. WHEN the schedule does not exist THEN the system SHALL return a 404 Not Found error
4. WHEN the user is not authorized to update the schedule THEN the system SHALL return a 403 Forbidden error
5. WHEN the request data is invalid THEN the system SHALL return a 400 Bad Request error with validation details
6. WHEN updating weekly slots THEN the system SHALL replace existing weekly slots with the new ones provided
