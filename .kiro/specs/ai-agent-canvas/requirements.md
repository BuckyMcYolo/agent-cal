# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Agent Canvas is the core differentiating feature of AgentCal that allows users to create, customize, and manage AI phone agents for handling scheduling calls. This drag-and-drop interface enables users to configure their agent's voice, personality, knowledge base, and scheduling capabilities without requiring technical expertise.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a scheduling platform user, I want to create and customize AI phone agents through a visual canvas interface, so that I can automate phone-based scheduling without technical knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the agent canvas THEN the system SHALL display a drag-and-drop interface with available agent components
2. WHEN a user drags a component onto the canvas THEN the system SHALL allow positioning and connection to other components
3. WHEN a user connects components THEN the system SHALL validate that connections are logically valid
4. WHEN a user saves an agent configuration THEN the system SHALL persist the agent setup to the database

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure my agent's voice and personality settings, so that the agent represents my brand and communication style appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects voice settings THEN the system SHALL provide options for voice type, tone, and speaking pace
2. WHEN a user configures personality traits THEN the system SHALL allow setting communication style, formality level, and response patterns
3. WHEN a user previews voice settings THEN the system SHALL provide audio samples of the configured voice
4. WHEN a user saves voice configuration THEN the system SHALL store the settings and associate them with the agent

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload documents and configure my agent's knowledge base, so that the agent can answer questions specific to my business and services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads documents THEN the system SHALL accept PDF, DOC, and TXT file formats
2. WHEN documents are uploaded THEN the system SHALL process them for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) integration
3. WHEN a user organizes knowledge base content THEN the system SHALL allow categorization and tagging of information
4. WHEN the agent accesses knowledge base THEN the system SHALL retrieve relevant information based on conversation context

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to connect my agent to specific event types and availability schedules, so that the agent can make bookings according to my calendar and preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user configures scheduling settings THEN the system SHALL display available event types from their account
2. WHEN a user selects event types THEN the system SHALL allow the agent to book those specific meeting types
3. WHEN a user sets availability preferences THEN the system SHALL respect those constraints during booking
4. WHEN the agent makes a booking THEN the system SHALL create the booking in the user's calendar and send confirmations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to test my agent configuration before deploying it, so that I can ensure it works correctly and represents my business appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates agent testing THEN the system SHALL provide a simulated phone conversation interface
2. WHEN a user interacts with the test agent THEN the system SHALL demonstrate the configured voice, personality, and knowledge
3. WHEN the test agent attempts to schedule THEN the system SHALL show the booking process without creating actual bookings
4. WHEN testing is complete THEN the system SHALL provide feedback on agent performance and suggestions for improvement

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to deploy my configured agent and receive a phone number, so that customers can call and interact with my AI scheduling assistant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user deploys an agent THEN the system SHALL provision a dedicated phone number for the agent
2. WHEN the agent is deployed THEN the system SHALL activate the phone service and route calls to the AI agent
3. WHEN a customer calls the agent number THEN the system SHALL handle the call using the configured agent settings
4. WHEN a call is completed THEN the system SHALL log the interaction and any bookings made

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to monitor my agent's performance and call history, so that I can optimize its effectiveness and track business impact.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views agent analytics THEN the system SHALL display call volume, success rates, and booking conversions
2. WHEN a user reviews call history THEN the system SHALL provide transcripts and summaries of agent interactions
3. WHEN a user analyzes performance THEN the system SHALL show metrics on response accuracy and customer satisfaction
4. WHEN issues are identified THEN the system SHALL provide recommendations for agent configuration improvements
