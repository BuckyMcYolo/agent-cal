# Rate Limits

The API has rate limits to ensure fair usage and prevent abuse. The following rate limits apply:

- **GET /tasks**: 100 requests per minute
- **GET /tasks/\{id\}**: 100 requests per minute
- **POST /tasks**: 50 requests per minute
- **PATCH /tasks/\{id\}**: 50 requests per minute
- **DELETE /tasks/\{id\}**: 50 requests per minute

## Rate Limit Headers

The API responses include the following headers to indicate your current rate limit status:

- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: The maximum number of requests you can make in the current time window.
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: The number of requests remaining in the current time window.
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: The time when the rate limit will reset, in UTC epoch seconds.

## Handling Rate Limits

If you exceed the rate limit, the API will return a `429 Too Many Requests` response. You should implement exponential backoff in your application to handle this gracefully.

## Example Rate Limit Headers

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-RateLimit-Limit: 100
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 99
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1633036800
```

This indicates that you have 99 requests remaining in the current time window, and the limit will reset at the specified epoch time.
