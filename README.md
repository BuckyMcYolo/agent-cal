# AgentCal

An open-source, AI-powered scheduling platform with intelligent phone agents built in.

## About

AgentCal is an open-source scheduling platform that allows users and teams to schedule events and meetings. It can be hosted on our platform or self-hosted on your own infrastructure.

## Key Features

- **AI Phone Agents**: Built directly into the core platform to handle scheduling calls
- **Customizable Agents**: Easily customize voice, knowledge base, and prompts using a drag-and-drop canvas interface
- **Knowledge Integration**: Upload documents to give your AI agents the ability to perform RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) when answering questions

## Motivation

This project was created to build a scheduling platform that integrates modern AI capabilities into the core experience, rather than as an afterthought. The goal is to create a truly intelligent scheduling system that can handle complex interactions through various channels, including phone calls.
